## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Wow, youâ€™re actually reading this! Hi! Thanks for checking out my profile.

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer at [BBC Design + Engineering](https://www.bbc.co.uk/backstage/design-engineering) working in the Presentation Layer team. We are rebuilding almost the entire website to work on a shared design system and a common framework and platform. Its exciting stuff! Iâ€™m based in MediaCityUK, Salford.

Iâ€™m an alumnus of [Aberystwyth University](https://www.aber.ac.uk/) (class of 2016!), where I studied [Computer Science](https://courses.aber.ac.uk/undergraduate/computer-science-degree-with-industrial-year/).

I am a full stack developer but most interested in Web standards (especially CSS!), Intrinsic Web Design and accessibility!

Iâ€™m also a [Christian](https://talksat.withgoogle.com/talk/making-sense-of-god-an-invitation-to-the-skeptical), a member of [City Church Manchester](http://www.citychurchmanchester.org/), a massive [Disney Parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Imagineering) fan and I think that [bourbon biscuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_biscuit) are better than custard creams!
